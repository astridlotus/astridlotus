- 👋 Hi, I’m Astrid! I am a future student at Oregon State and working towards a degree in Computer Science! I am interested in expanding technology and software in structural/civil engineering
- 🌱 I am very enthusiastic about learning new technology and as a new programmer I hope to learn more about mobile applications this summer to expand upon my existing experience with Java, Javascript, HTML/CSS, Python and SQL.
- 🐋 This summer I am working as an IT Intern and Summer camp instructor for Lavner Education (Specifically Tech Revolution)! I will be teaching intro classes on topics such as basic computer skills, Java, Python, C++ and even Film Production!
- 💞️ In my personal life, I enjoy playing guitar, being outside and crocheting! I hope to learn to ski this winter as well ⛷️
